The numbers 6 and 6 are relatively large compared to 1, so they might play a significant role in reaching 24.\n\n2. **Exploration of Multiplication**: \n   - Multiplying the two 6s gives 36, which is too large, but we can consider using division or subtraction to adjust.\n   - Consider the expression (6 * 4), since 6 * 4 = 24. We need to form 4 using the remaining numbers 1, 1, and 6.\n\n3. **Forming 4**:\n   - Using the numbers 1, 1, and 6, we can form 4 by (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) or (6 / 1.5), but these are not directly possible with the given numbers.\n   - Instead, consider using subtraction: 6 - 2 = 4. We can form 2 by using 1 + 1.\n\n4. **Combining Steps**:\n   - Use the expression (6 - (1 + 1)) to form 4.\n   - Multiply this result by the other 6: (6 - (1 + 1)) * 6 = 4 * 6 = 24.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check the expression: (6 - (1 + 1)) * 6 = (6 - 2) * 6 = 4 * 6 = 24.\n   - All numbers are used exactly once, and the operations are valid.\n\n## Final Answer (JSON format):\n```json\n{\"numbers\": [1, 1, 6, 6], \"solution\": \"(6-(1+1))*6\"}\n```", "parsed_expression": "(6-(1+1))*6", "eval_result": 24, "is_correct": true, "error_type": null, "input_tokens": 133, "output_tokens": 554, "total_tokens": 687, "timestamp": "2025-06-30T12:00:54.958916"}
